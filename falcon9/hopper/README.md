# Falcon 9 Hopper [Not Done]
A bit like grasshopper, but shorter. Mainly am making this for two reasons:
1. To help me learn PID loops. These will be helpful later on down the line in landing the actual booster with much higher precision.
2. KSP does not feature stock landing legs that are big enough for a F9 replica, so I am figuring out how to make legs with hinges.
