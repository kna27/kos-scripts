# Hawk mk1
A rocket with a RTLS first stage, kind of like a mini Falcon 9. 'm working on creating an actual Falcon 9 replica using some of this code to help with it.

# About
kOS CPU on both first and second stage, make sure to set each boot file (pretty clear which one is which) on the CPUs if they are not already set.

# To Use
Install the kOS mod.

Drag and drop the Hawk Mk I v2.craft file into your `Kerbal Space Program\saves\[SAVE NAME]\Ships\VAB` folder.

Drag and drop the two boot scripts into your `Kerbal Space Program\Ships\Script\boot` folder.

Drag and drop the other two kOS script files into your `Kerbal Space Program\Ships\Script` folder.

It should already be set, but if not just choose the boot scripts you just downloaded as the boot script for each CPU (boot-hawk-mk1.ks for lower stage and 
boot-hawk-mk1-s2.ks for upper stage).
